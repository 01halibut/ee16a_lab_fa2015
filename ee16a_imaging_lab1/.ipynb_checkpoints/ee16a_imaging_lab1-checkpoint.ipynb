    "Welcome to the first of 3 labs in imaging module, in which you will actually build the imaging system introduced in [Lecture 2](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~ee16a/fa15/lecture/imaging_intro.pptx). The physical components of this system include a projector, a solar cell, sensing circuit, and a [TI MSP430](http://www.ti.com/ww/en/launchpad/launchpad.html?DCMP=rtos&HQS=ep-sdo-rtos-pr-lp-launchpad-en) microcontroller. The full imaging system is shown below: \n",

    "<br><br>\n",
    "Digital images are composed of a grid of [pixels](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel), each of which represents a single color. In order to create this digital representation, optical imaging systems measure the energy, in this case light, reflected off of objects to determine the values of these pixels. Because different colors reflect different amounts of light, measurements of reflected light intensity can be used to differentiate between colors.\n",

    "Commercial cameras such as those found in smartphones use chips called CMOS image sensors to measure millions of pixel values at a time (think of this as millions of devices akin to the solar cell that all fit on an approximately 30mm$^2$ chip). In contrast, our system can only measure one light intensity value at a time, so we will instead use a controlled energy source, the projector, to illuminate specific regions of the image at a time and record the energy that reflects off the subject for one region at a time.\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The solar cell converts light to induce a flow of electrons, and the circuit then outputs a voltage corresponding to light intensity. The specific configuration of the circuit sets the solar cell up so it is most sensitive to changes in light. \n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "This changing voltage is now a set of real numbers and much closer to something we can use to represent our image on a computer. Unfortunately, our computers don't have enough memory to represent an infinite number of values so we use a microcontroller (MSP430) to take samples of this signal and convert it to a set of numbers we can then use in IPython.\n",

    "Remember that a voltage is defined as a difference in electric potential between two points. For example, the voltage source we will be using in this lab has a potential difference of +3.3V between the positive and negative terminals of the source. Because a voltage requires two points to define, it is often convenient to define a common point in a circuit as a reference. This reference voltage, commonly referred to as \"ground\" is defined by convention to be 0V, and therefore allows us to conveniently describe voltages at any point in the circuit with respect to 0.  \n",

Microcontrollers are found at the heart of all embedded devices and have enough processing power to perform simple tasks using very little power. Because of its limited processing capabilites, the MSP430 doesn't run an operating system like desktop computers or servers; instead the device just executes a single function continuously in a loop as soon as it is powered on. For our application this simple program reads a single voltage value and sends it to a computer via the USB connection. We will now walk through the process of using a MSP430 and uploading code to it.\n",

To resolve this issue simply go to \"Tools>Update Programmer\". Then re-upload the desired code file. Once the \"Programming successful\" message is displayed, the MSP430 will repeatedly execute the code whenever it is powered on.
