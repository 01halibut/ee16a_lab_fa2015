    "## Introduction\n",
    "The resistive touchscreen you built last week is well-suited for devices using a stylus because the screen has to be deformed in order to sense a touch. Additionally it is common in many appliances and computer peripherals, such as keyboards, to sense button presses. However, most devices today do not require a stylus or a hard press, they work by using the device we will cover today - the capacitive touchscreen.\n",

    "The diagram above shows the typical way capacitive touch screens are implemented. One of the lines is driven to a certain voltage while another line parallel to it is grounded. When a finger (which is also grounded) comes near the lines, it takes away some of the electric field between the two lines, thus reducing the capacitance between the lines. \n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "Today we will be implementing a system that is similar to this, but instead of putting the lines next to each other we will stack them up at a particular point and measure the capacitance there. Since we stack the lines up, bringing your finger near the lines will not change the capacitance between the lines. Instead, we add another capacitance between the top line and your finger (ground), resulting in two capacitors in parallel. As we have learned, parallel capacitances add up, so we can measure this increase in capacitance.\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "Although we could build a multi-touch touchscreen using this approach, today we will only build a single-touch touchpad because of the complexity of the sensing circuit. We will later see how to extend your touchpad to a screen."
