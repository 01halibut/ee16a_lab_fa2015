Lastly, you will put your soldering skills to the test and build a resistive touch screen.\n",

Resistive touch screens are comprised of two conductive layers, separated by an insulating layer such as air or microbeads. When enough pressure is applied, the conductive layers touch and form a simple circuit called a voltage divider.\n",

    "Touch screens have two main jobs: 1) detect a touch 2) determine the location of a touch with respect to a predefined origin. The first task is usually accomplished by using a [\"pull-up\" resistor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pull-up_resistor). The second task is accomplished by taking advantage of fact that each conductive layer reduces to a voltage divider. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each conductive layer of a touch screen is responsible for determining position in a single axis. Since we setup the touch screen so that these axes are orthogonal, we can successfully determine the Cartesian position of a touch. To detect the position of a touch along a single axis, we must apply a voltage across one conductive layer, and then use the other conductive layer to sense the voltage between the contact point and ground. By applying KCL or KVL, we can determine the relationships below for touching a point along one axis of the circuit, where the \"height\" and width\" correspond to the number of resistors along an axis.\n",
